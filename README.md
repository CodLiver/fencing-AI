# Using Deep Learning to Referee Fencing

In 2 of the 3 types of fencing, when both competitors hit eachother within a few miliseconds both sides of the scoreboard will light up. Then the referee has to make a decision on who's point it is. As a rough rule of thumb, it goes to who took more initiative or who had more control over what happened. I was curious to see if machine learning could fill in for the referee, and so far the model has 60% accuracy (up from the 33% that would be random chance of choosing between left/right/together).
